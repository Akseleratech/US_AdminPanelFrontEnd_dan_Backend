# API Endpoint Security Strategy

## Security Analysis & Recommendations

### üîí Critical Endpoints (Admin Only)
These endpoints contain sensitive internal data and must be secured:

#### `/dashboard` (Fixed ‚úÖ)
- `/dashboard/stats` - Internal metrics and statistics
- `/dashboard/recent-orders` - Order history and customer data  
- `/dashboard/quick-stats` - Business intelligence data
- **Security Applied**: Admin or Staff authentication required

#### `/database` (Fixed ‚úÖ)  
- `/database/collections` - Database schema information
- `/database/stats` - Database performance metrics
- `/database/health` - System internals
- **Security Applied**: Admin authentication required

### üåê Public Mobile Endpoints (Kept Public)
These endpoints provide public information needed by mobile apps:

#### `/cities` (Public GET)
- `GET /cities` - List of available cities for mobile app
- `GET /cities/:id` - City details for mobile booking
- **Justification**: Mobile users need to see available cities
- **Protection**: Rate limiting applied

#### `/services` (Public GET)
- `GET /services` - List of available services for mobile app
- `GET /services/:id` - Service details for mobile booking  
- **Justification**: Mobile users need to see available services
- **Protection**: Rate limiting applied

#### `/spaces` (Public GET)
- `GET /spaces` - List of available spaces for mobile booking
- `GET /spaces/:id` - Space details for mobile booking
- `GET /spaces/:id/availability` - Real-time availability for booking
- **Justification**: Core mobile app functionality
- **Protection**: Rate limiting applied

#### `/promos` (Public GET)
- `GET /promos` - Active promotions for mobile app
- `GET /promos/:id` - Promo details for mobile app
- **Justification**: Marketing content for mobile users
- **Protection**: Rate limiting applied

### üîê Protected Endpoints (Auth Required)
These endpoints require authentication for security:

#### `/customers` (Secured ‚úÖ)
- All operations require Admin authentication
- Contains PII and customer data

#### `/orders` (Secured ‚úÖ)  
- All operations require Admin or Staff authentication
- Contains booking and payment information

#### `/invoices` (Secured ‚úÖ)
- All operations require Admin authentication
- Contains financial data

### ‚öñÔ∏è Security vs Usability Balance

#### Public Data Strategy
- **Cities, Services, Spaces, Promos**: Keep public for mobile app functionality
- **Dashboard, Database**: Secured for internal use only
- **Customer, Order, Invoice data**: Always secured

#### Protection Layers
1. **Rate Limiting**: All endpoints have rate limiting
2. **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are sanitized
3. **Authentication**: Sensitive data requires authentication
4. **Authorization**: Role-based access control

#### Mobile App Considerations
- Mobile apps need access to public catalog data
- Booking functionality requires space/service information
- Marketing promos need to be visible
- User-specific data (orders, invoices) handled through authenticated endpoints

### Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- Dashboard endpoints secured (Admin/Staff only)
- Database endpoints secured (Admin only)  
- Rate limiting applied to all endpoints
- Input sanitization implemented

üîÑ **Maintained Public**:
- Cities GET endpoints (for mobile app)
- Services GET endpoints (for mobile app)
- Spaces GET endpoints (for mobile app)  
- Promos GET endpoints (for mobile app)

### Security Headers & Monitoring

All endpoints now include:
- Rate limit headers for client awareness
- Comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- Fail-safe error handling
- Input validation and sanitization
